# RTL-to-GDS-Implementation-of-Low-Power-Configurable-Multi-Clock-Domain-Digital-System
## Description
It is responsible of receiving commands through UART receiver to do different system functions as register file reading/writing or doing some processing using ALU block and send result to UART transmitter through asynchronous FIFO for handling different clock rates and avoid data loss.

### 1) Clock Domain 1 (REF_CLK)
    RegFile: Stores system and user registers. Supports read and write operations controlled by SYS_CTRL.
    ALU: Performs arithmetic and logic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and bitwise logic.
    Clock Gating: Controls ALUâ€™s clock based on enable signals to save power.
    SYS_CTRL: Central control unit responsible for interpreting UART commands, controlling ALU and RegFile, and managing data flow.

### 2) Clock Domain 2 (UART_CLK)
    UART_TX: Transmits serial data frames to the master.
    UART_RX: Receives serial data frames from the master.
    PULSE_GEN: Generates a pulse signal based on UART_TX status.
    Clock Dividers: Divides the UART clock based on programmable division ratio.

### 3) Synchronizers
    RST Synchronizer: Synchronizes reset signals between clock domains.
    Data Synchronizer: Synchronizes control and data signals across domains.
    ASYNC FIFO: Buffers data safely between asynchronous clock domains.
